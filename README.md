<h1>🚀 Real-Time Object Detection & Visualization using Computer Vision</h1>


📌 <h2> Overview </h2>
This project leverages Computer Vision to perform real-time object detection for two classes:
🔹 Person 👤
🔹 Car 🚗

Additionally, it provides visual insights into the detected objects by calculating the proportions of each class in the scene, making it highly valuable for real-time applications.

🎯 <h2> Key Features <h2>
✅ Real-Time Detection – Works efficiently on live video streams 📹
✅ Multi-Class Support – Detects and classifies people & cars 🔍
✅ Data Visualization – Displays object distribution dynamically 📊
✅ Edge & Cloud Compatibility – Can run on local machines, edge devices, or cloud platforms ☁️
✅ Customizable – Easily extendable to other object classes 🎯

🔥<h2> Use Cases </h2>
🔹 Traffic & Parking Management 🚦
🔹 Crowd Monitoring & Analysis 👥
🔹 Smart Surveillance & Security 🔐
🔹 Retail & Smart Cities Applications 🏙️

🛠️ <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
🔸 YOLOv11  – for object detection 🧠
🔸 OpenCV – for image processing 📸
🔸 Python – the backbone of the project 🐍

📊 <h2>Results & Visualization</h2>
The project provides real-time feedback on detected objects along with dynamic charts representing object distributions.


📌 Future Enhancements
🚀 Support for more object classes
🚀 Integration with IoT & Edge AI devices
