<h1>🚀 Real-Time Object Detection & Visualization using Computer Vision</h1>


<h2>📌  Overview </h2>
This project leverages Computer Vision to perform real-time object detection for two classes:
🔹 Person 👤
🔹 Car 🚗

Additionally, it provides visual insights into the detected objects by calculating the proportions of each class in the scene, making it highly valuable for real-time applications.

<h2>🎯  Key Features <h2>
  
✅ Real-Time Detection – Works efficiently on live video streams 📹

✅ Multi-Class Support – Detects and classifies people & cars 🔍

✅ Data Visualization – Displays object distribution dynamically 📊

✅ Edge & Cloud Compatibility – Can run on local machines, edge devices, or cloud platforms ☁️

✅ Customizable – Easily extendable to other object classes 🎯

<h2>🔥 Use Cases </h2>

🔹 Traffic & Parking Management 🚦

🔹 Crowd Monitoring & Analysis 👥

🔹 Smart Surveillance & Security 🔐

🔹 Retail & Smart Cities Applications 🏙️


<h2>🛠️ Tech Stack</h2>

🔸 YOLOv11  – for object detection 🧠

🔸 OpenCV – for image processing 📸

🔸 Python – the backbone of the project 🐍


<h2>📊 Results & Visualization</h2>

The project provides real-time feedback on detected objects along with dynamic charts representing object distributions.


<h2>📌 Future Enhancements</h2>

🚀 Support for more object classes

🚀 Integration with IoT & Edge AI devices
